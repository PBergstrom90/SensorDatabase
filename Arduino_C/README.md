# Arduino - Temperature Sensor
## Build
Binary is built and uploaded to the Arduino using PlatformIO for Visual Studio Code.

## Usage
The program expects the Vout of the voltage divider to be connected to A0 on the Arduino. You can see the wiring in this example: https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-thermistor-temperature-sensor-tutorial/. The temperature in celsius will then be transmitted via serial from the Arduino.
